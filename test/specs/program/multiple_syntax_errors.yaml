description: Three different kinds of syntax errors with recovery

input: |-
  var name /* missing semicolon*/ 
  print /* missing expr*/;
  1 - /* missing right operand! */;

expectations:
  parsing: |-
    - ┌─ Syntax error at line 2, column 1
      |
    2 | print /* missing expr*/;
      | ^
      |     Expected to see an `=` for variable assignment
    - ┌─ Syntax error at line 2, column 6
      |
    2 | print /* missing expr*/;
      |      ^
      |     A print clause is of the form ` print <expr>; `, you're missing the expr!
    - ┌─ Syntax error at line 3, column 33
      |
    3 | 1 - /* missing right operand! */;
      |                                 ^
      |     Expected a number, string, or expression after operator
