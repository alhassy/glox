/// A parser really has two jobs:
///
/// Given a valid sequence of tokens, produce a corresponding syntax tree.
/// 
/// Given an invalid sequence of tokens, detect any errors and tell the user about their mistakes.
/// 
/// Don’t underestimate how important the second job is! In modern IDEs and editors, 
/// the parser is constantly reparsing code—often while the user is still editing it
/// —in order to syntax highlight and support things like auto-complete. 
/// That means it will encounter code in incomplete, half-wrong states all the time.
/// 
/// When the user doesn’t realize the syntax is wrong, it is up to the parser to 
/// help guide them back onto the right path. The way it reports errors is a large 
/// part of your language’s user interface.
/// 
/// While the source may not be valid code, it’s still a valid input to the 
/// parser because users use the parser to learn what syntax is allowed.
/// 
/// (1) Report as many distinct errors as there are. Aborting after the first error is easy to implement, 
/// but it’s annoying for users if every time they fix what they think is the one error in a file,
///  a new one appears. They want to see them all.
/// 
/// (2) Minimize cascaded errors. Once a single error is found, the parser no longer really knows what’s 
/// going on. It tries to get itself back on track and keep going, but if it gets confused, 
/// it may report a slew of ghost errors that don’t indicate other real problems in the code.
///  When the first error is fixed, those phantoms disappear, because they reflect only the 
/// parser’s own confusion. Cascaded errors are annoying because they can scare the user into 
/// thinking their code is in a worse state than it is.
/// 
/// The last two points are in tension. We want to report as many separate errors as we can, 
/// but we don’t want to report ones that are merely side effects of an earlier one.
/// 
/// The way a parser responds to an error and keeps going to look for later errors is called (syntax) error recovery. 
/// For example, in the panic mode strategy, when a parse encounters an error ---eg a missing closing quote for a string literal---
/// then it tries to discard the tokens for the string literal and keep parsing with the remaining tokens.
/// Usually, the amount of tokens it discards are determined by a grammar rule; so if the string literal appears in a statement rule,
/// we discard that rule and move to the next statement and continue parsing from there. 
/// This dropping tokens and moving on process is called synchronization.
///

  /// This reports an error at a given token. It shows the token’s location and the token itself. 
  /// This will come in handy later since we use tokens throughout the interpreter to track locations in code.
  /// 
  /// This is a simple sentinel class we use to unwind the parser. 
  /// The error() method returns the error instead of throwing it because we want to let the calling 
  /// method inside the parser decide whether to unwind or not. 
  /// Some parse errors occur in places where the parser isn’t likely to get into a weird state 
  /// and we don’t need to synchronize. In those places, we simply report the error and keep on truckin’.

/// Synchronizing a recursive descent parser
/// 
/// With recursive descent, the parser’s state—which rules it is in the middle of recognizing
/// —is not stored explicitly in fields. Instead, we use Java’s own call stack to track what 
/// the parser is doing. Each rule in the middle of being parsed is a call frame on the stack. 
/// In order to reset that state, we need to clear out those call frames.
/// 
/// The natural way to do that in Java is exceptions. When we want to synchronize,
///  we throw that ParseError object. Higher up in the method for the grammar rule we are 
/// synchronizing to, we’ll catch it. Since we synchronize on statement boundaries, 
/// we’ll catch the exception there. After the exception is caught, the parser is in the right state. 
/// All that’s left is to synchronize the tokens.
/// 
/// We want to discard tokens until we’re right at the beginning of the next statement. 
/// That boundary is pretty easy to spot—it’s one of the main reasons we picked it. 
/// After a semicolon, we’re _probably_ finished with a statement. Most statements start with a 
/// keyword —for, if, return, var, etc. 
/// When the next token is any of those, we’re probably about to start a statement.
/// 
/// (I say “probably” because we could hit a semicolon separating clauses in a for loop. 
/// Our synchronization isn’t perfect, but that’s OK. We’ve already reported the first error precisely, 
/// so everything after that is kind of “best effort”.)

/// 2. If token is SEMICOLON, excellent we're at a boundary so exit.
/// 3. If we're at the start of a new expression, ie we see `class, fun, var, for, if, while, print, return`,
///    then exit since we have now dropped all tokens related to the previous parse error and are now safe to continue parsing again.
///    Otherwise, if we're not at the start of a new expression, then we're still part of the syntactically errenous expression, so
///    discard the current token: That is, do nothing with it and go to step 1.
/// 
/// It discards tokens until it thinks it has found a statement boundary. 
/// After catching a ParseError, we’ll call this and then we are hopefully back in sync. 
/// When it works well, we have discarded tokens that would have likely caused cascaded errors 
/// anyway, and now we can parse the rest of the file starting at the next statement.
